# Instruments of the Chrysanthemum Throne System

![Foundry v11](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v11-green)

This is a system for running the campaign of Instruments of the Chrysanthemum Throne, the wonderful game written by Dale Elvy for Imaginay Empire Games.
The system is created by a novice in Foundry using the Bolerplate system as a base, with the purpose of running a live campaign with it and also learning FoundryVTT programming. I'll keep updating the system as I run games and find bugs or the need for better or additional features. Any bug, error or omission you find are caused by me, no the original authors of Boilerplate (Asacolips and Lee Talman )
